        <h3 style="font-size: 1.5vw">From the lead filled water fountains to famous astronaut Chris Hadfield graduating from our school, White Oaks has a lot of originality to offer, 
            much of it thanks to the students present. Seeing debaters on team Canada and students that crush national math competitions in the hallways is not a rare sight.
            From our stellar band to the fact that we rank 21 out of 749 Ontario High Schools, it is obvious that White Oaks is special. In order to capture this amazing 
            group of people, we devised a survey to get to know more about this years graduates. We hope you enjoy!</h3>

                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Apparently not! It turns out about 3% of respondents (about X students) have never been. Not sure whether to offer those students congratulations or condolences...just have to ask one question: Why?</h3>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Oakville Place is by far the most popular mall for WOSS students to visit. The food is not great and the stores are not interesting, but it's a must go regardless. Students make the trek through fields and scramble through the adjacent school yards to get there. With so many pros to going, who wouldn't want to vist?</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Well, 19.8% of respondents (approximately X students), that's who. We are shocked! Even with the obvious deterrents, walking to Oakville place only to spend 20 minutes there is a rite of passage. Tsk, tsk, tsk.</h3>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">The staircases at WOSS are wonderfully multi-functional. You can go up them, and you can go down them. However, some students decide to get "creative" with their use. Unfortunately, the underside of the staircase is still accessible to the poor other students who have the misfortune of coming across such ... passion. </h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> According to our survey, over 47% of respondents (approximately X students) have seen such a display unfold. Devastating. Luckily,on the other side, almost an equal number of respondents have not seen it either. Unexpectedly, 9.4%(approximately X students) of respondents were the ones commiting such acts. I just hope it was worth it. </h3>

However, Mr. Mistry made it his mission this year to ensure that we were always just as stressed as he is uptight. RIP to the students who have been caught (can't relate lol). </h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> It looks like approximately 20.6% of respondents (X students) can relate! That is less than we expected, though it's important to remember that not everybody has a skipping problem. To Y student that were not caught, congratulations! You avoided the shameful walk back to class or, even worse, phone call to your parents.</h3>

                Stories of Ms.Loft's rules and difficult policies have definitely made it around campus. Whether it be about prom table seating or student council elections,
                Ms.Loft seems to make things tricky. Whether there is any truth to the rumours is anecdotal, but it's still interesting to see just what portion of WOSS's
                graduating class fought these battles nonetheless.
                <br>
                <br>
                According to our survey, only 13.6% of respondents (approximately X students) actually fought with Ms.Loft. Whether this is an abnormally large or small portion of
                the population depends on your opinion of Ms.Loft, but seeing as more than X students in one single grade have had problems with one teacher is ... slightly telling.
                If we assume that the respondents that chose "Don't even ask" also had problems with Ms.Loft, the number more than doubles, which is much more significant. Godspeed 
                soldiers.

                Every student knows that the bathrooms at WOSS aren't exactly used as bathrooms most of the time. From people just hanging out, vape parties and even fights, 
                the bathrooms are for all things unholy. Heck, the boys main bathroom door had to be taken off due to the amount of vapers. 
                <br>
                <br>
                According to our survey, 16.4% of respondents (approximately X students) have vaped or gotten high in the bathroom, which actually not as many as expected 
                how promiment they are. To these X students however, y'all are menaces. Please stop scaring the freshmen (and us too).

                During our grade 9 and early 10th year, South Cafeteria used to be the main place for hanging out at break. However, due to the pandemic and lack of manpower, WOSS closed South caf for all periods 
                other than lunch. Even during break, you aren't lucky enough to snag a table right away, you're usually out of luck. As such, us graduates have had to be creative with our hangout spots!

                According to our survey, the majority of graduates (X students) find a random classroom to hangout in, which doubles the next most popular spots, the cafeteria and outside. Other than that, the
