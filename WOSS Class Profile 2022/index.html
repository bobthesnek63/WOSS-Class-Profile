        <h3 style="font-size: 1.5vw">From the lead filled water fountains to famous astronaut Chris Hadfield graduating from our school, White Oaks has a lot of originality to offer, 
            much of it thanks to the students present. Seeing debaters on team Canada and students that crush national math competitions in the hallways is not a rare sight.
            From our stellar band to the fact that we rank 21 out of 749 Ontario High Schools, it is obvious that White Oaks is special. In order to capture this amazing 
            group of people, we devised a survey to get to know more about this years graduates. We hope you enjoy!</h3>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Apparently not! It turns out about 3% of respondents (about X students) have never been. Not sure whether to offer those students congratulations or condolences...just have to ask one question: Why?</h3>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Oakville Place is by far the most popular mall for WOSS students to visit. The food is not great and the stores are not interesting, but it's a must go regardless. Students make the trek through fields and scramble through the adjacent school yards to get there. With so many pros to going, who wouldn't want to vist?</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Well, 19.8% of respondents (approximately X students), that's who. We are shocked! Even with the obvious deterrents, walking to Oakville place only to spend 20 minutes there is a rite of passage. Tsk, tsk, tsk.</h3>

            <div id="answer-text">
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">The staircases at WOSS are wonderfully multi-functional. You can go up them, and you can go down them. However, some students decide to get "creative" with their use. Unfortunately, the underside of the staircase is still accessible to the poor other students who have the misfortune of coming across such ... passion. </h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> According to our survey, over 47% of respondents (approximately X students) have seen such a display unfold. Devastating. Luckily,on the other side, almost an equal number of respondents have not seen it either. Unexpectedly, 9.4%(approximately X students) of respondents were the ones commiting such acts. I just hope it was worth it. </h3>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> With our senior year being a time of newfound freedom, many students opted to sign themselves out or just straight up skip classes when they felt like it. However, Mr. Mistry and Mr. Stevens made it their mission this year to ensure that we were always just as stressed as they are uptight. RIP to the students who have been caught (can't relate lol). </h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> It looks like approximately 20.6% of respondents (X students) can relate! That is less than we expected, though it's important to remember that not everybody has a skipping problem. To Y student that were not caught, congratulations! You avoided the shameful walk back to class or, even worse, phone call to your parents.</h3>

Whether it be about prom table seating or student council elections, Ms.Loft seems to find joy in making our lives more difficult. Many a student has had to go head to head with her, and we wanted to know just how many.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> According to our survey, 13.6% of respondents have fought with Ms. Loft, and 14.5% of them have had some sort of incident that we shouldn't even ask about. Seems about right. To all those who have had to face her, godspeed. </h3>

If you ever wondered why the doors got taken off the main bathrooms, there you go. So we wanted to know how many of our graduating class are bathroom trouble makers...</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> and we were disappointed! Or possibly we were not disappointed, depending on whether or not our official stance is supporting bathroom vaping. 16.4% of respondents have participated in said activity, which is actually less than we expected. To the X students who did, though, y'all are menaces. (We love it) </h3>

                <div id="answer-text">
                    <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> Due to the pandemic, WOSS admin chose to close South Caf to anybody who didn't have a third period spare at the beginning of this year. Because of this, people had to get creative with where they spend break. At the time, it was miserable, but I think it was a little bit of a blessing in disguise because of how many awesome hangout spots we discovered. Now people hang out everywhere!</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> According to our survey, the majority of graduates (X students) find a random classroom to hangout in, which doubles the next most popular spots, the cafeteria and outside. Other than that, the interesting piece of data is that Y students regularly hang out at Oakville place, which is a solid distance away. Driving there repeatedly with todays gas prices? Mad lads. </h3>
