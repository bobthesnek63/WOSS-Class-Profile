        <h3 style="font-size: 1.5vw">From the lead filled water fountains to famous astronaut Chris Hadfield graduating from our school, White Oaks has a lot of originality to offer, 
            much of it thanks to the students present. Seeing debaters on team Canada and students that crush national math competitions in the hallways is not a rare sight.
            From our stellar band to the fact that we rank 21 out of 749 Ontario High Schools, it is obvious that White Oaks is special. In order to capture this amazing 
            group of people, we devised a survey to get to know more about this years graduates. We hope you enjoy!</h3>

        <div id="answer">
            <div id="answer-text">
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">The most common lunchtime spot for WOSS students, the White store earned its name through... its color? Possibly a shortening of "The White Oaks Store"? Nobody knows, but what we do know is that everybody has been...right?</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Apparently not! It turns out about 3% of respondents (about X students) have never been. Not sure whether to offer those students congratulations or condolences...just have to ask one question: Why?</h3>

        </div>

        <div id="answer">
            <div id="answer-text">
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Oakville Place is by far the most popular mall for WOSS students to visit. The food is not great and the stores are not interesting, but it's a must go regardless. Students make the trek through fields and scramble through the adjacent school yards to get there. With so many pros to going, who wouldn't want to vist?</h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">Well, 19.8% of respondents (approximately X students), that's who. We are shocked! Even with the obvious deterrents, walking to Oakville place only to spend 20 minutes there is a rite of passage. Tsk, tsk, tsk.</h3>

        <div id="sectionSubtitle">
            <h1 style="font-size: 2vw">The Staircase</h1>
        </div>

        <div id="question">

        </div>

        <div id="answer">
            <div id="answer-text">
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw">The staircases at WOSS are wonderfully multi-functional. You can go up them, and you can go down them. However, some students decide to get "creative" with their use. Unfortunately, the underside of the staircase is still accessible to the poor other students who have the misfortune of coming across such ... passion. </h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> According to our survey, over 47% of respondents (approximately X students) have seen such a display unfold. Devastating. Luckily,on the other side, almost an equal number of respondents have not seen it either. Unexpectedly, 9.4%(approximately X students) of respondents were the ones commiting such acts. I just hope it was worth it. </h3>

        <div id="answer">
            <div id="answer-text">
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> With our senior year being a time of newfound freedom, many students opted to sign themselves out or just straight up skip classes when they felt like it. However, Mr. Mistry and Mr. Stevens made it their mission this year to ensure that we were always just as stressed as they are uptight. RIP to the students who have been caught (can't relate lol). </h3>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2vw"> It looks like approximately 20.6% of respondents (X students) can relate! That is less than we expected, though it's important to remember that not everybody has a skipping problem. To Y student that were not caught, congratulations! You avoided the shameful walk back to class or, even worse, phone call to your parents.</h3>
